Here we set Teamcity so it contains 2 build steps: one successful and other one failing because of system property `fail-build` set in build steps.
These build steps should be set by the VCS root attached to the GitHub project (described below), which contains test system property `fail-build`.

1. download TeamCity for Linux from https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/ .TAR.GZ -> Linux/macOS(.tar.gz)
2. extract files with `tar xvzf TeamCity-2019.1.2.tar.gz`
3. run `cd TeamCity/bin/`
4. run `./runAll.sh start`
5. access TeamCity web UI via web browser with address http://localhost:8111
    - set Data Directory location on the TeamCity server machine (you can use default)
    - select the database type (use Internal)
    - accept license agreement
    - create administration account (e.g. username=admin, password=123456)
6. create project (Administration -> Projects -> +Create project)
    - choose option "Manually" and enter e.g.:
        - Parent project: <Root project>
        - Name: Test Repo
        - Project ID: TestRepo
7. create aggregation build configuration (Administration -> Projects -> Test Repo -> +Create build configuration)
    - choose option "Manually" and enter e.g.:
        - Name: Aggregator
        - Build Configuration ID: TestRepo_Aggregator
    - after it's created, set the VCS root:
        - Type of VCS: Git
        - VCS root name: e.g. refs/heads/master
        - VCS root ID: TestRepo_RefsHeadsMaster
        - Fetch URL: URL of your repository
        - Default branch: refs/heads/master
        - Branch specification: +:refs/*/head
8. create build configuration with build step (Administration -> Projects -> Test Repo -> +Create build configuration)
    - choose option "Manually" and enter e.g.:
            - Name: Build
            - Build Configuration ID: TestRepo_Build
    - after it's created, set the VCS root (you can attach already existing refs/heads/master)
    - add build step (Administration -> Projects -> Test Repo -> Build -> Build Steps -> +Add build step):
        - Runner type: Maven
        - Execute step: If all previous steps finished successfully
        - Goals: clean test
        - Path to POM file: pom.xml
        - Additional Maven command line parameters: -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true
                                                    -Dfail-build=true
9. create another build configuration with build step same way (e.g. Build2)
    -only difference is system property `fail-build` in build step e.g. -Dfail-build=false
10. Add snapshot dependencies of both builds with build step (Build, Build2) into aggregation build (Aggregator)
    (Administration -> Projects -> Test Repo -> Aggregator -> Dependencies -> +Add snapshot dependency)
    - select both build configurations
    - check "Enforce revisions synchronization", "Do not run new build if there is a suitable one", "Only use successful builds from suitable ones"
11. run `mkdir /yourPath/tyr/tyr-runner/tyr_config_dir`
12. this directory should contain:
    - file admin-list.txt (containing only your GitHub user name e.g. khermano)
    - file user-list.txt (containing only your GitHub user name e.g. khermano)
    - file format.yaml (you can find template as /tyr/tyr-runner/src/main/resources/format-example.yaml)
    - file config.properties (you can find template as /tyr/tyr-runner/src/main/resources/config.properties.template)
        - github.oauth.token=yourToken
        - whitelist.enabled=true
        - teamcity.host=localhost
        - teamcity.port=8111
        - teamcity.user=admin
        - teamcity.password=123456
        - teamcity.branch.mapping=master=>TestRepo_Aggregator
13. run `mvn clean compile quarkus:dev -Dtyr.config.dir="/yourPath/tyr/tyr-runner/tyr_config_dir"`
